To have WatirCuke support snippets just unpack the <b>WatirCuke.tmbundle.zip</b> which is in my github in TextMateBundles repo and place it in

<b>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles</b>

Then in TextMate -> Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles

Snippets should work for .feature files.
