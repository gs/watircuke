INSTALL
         
First be sure to have installed Ruby(1.8.7) and RubyGems
       
Then install:

gem install geminstaller

Then checkout the WatirCuke git repo (if not yet done ;) ) and type

geminstaller config/geminstaller.yml

This will install all necessary gems.

Then install JSSH for FireWatir:
http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+Installation
                                                         
For MacOSX I recommend to install:
Textmate syntax recognition and snippets for Cucumber

http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle


To have WatirCuke support snippets just unpack the WatirCuke.tmbundle.zip which is in my github in TextMateBundles repo and place it in

~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

Then in TextMate -> Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles

Snippets should work for .feature files.

Below are currently supported sentences: 

Actions:

link[tab]      I click the "some" button  
checkbox[tab]  I click the "some" checkbox  
image[tab] 	   I click the "some" image  
link[tab]      I click/onmouseover the "some" link (with alert)  
radio[tab]     I click the "some" radio button  
table[tab]	   I click row "some" in the "some" table  
list[tab]	   I select "some" from "from list"  
tf[tab]		   I fill in the text field "text field name" with "some text / fraze (from http://chronic.rubyforge.org/ are supported)"
ff[tab]		   I fill in the file field "file field name" with "file path"
div[tab]       I click the "some" div
*screenshot[tab] I take a screenshot    
debug[tab]	   I debug
refresh[tab]   I refresh the page

Check results:        
check_image[tab] Then I should see the "some image" image
check_span[tab]  Then I should see the span "some class" with "some text"
check_sentence[tab] Then I should (NOT )?see the sentence "some sentence" 
check_text[tab]	  Then I should (NOT )?see the text "some text"
check_all[tab]   Then I check all objects (this will dump all page objects to file)

Paths redirection:
red[tab]	I am redirected to "some"  
on[tab]	 	I am on the "server" page 
goto[tab]	I go to "some url"
sleep[tab]	I sleep for "some"


tag @new_feature - putted above the scenario will force watircuke to make a screenshot after each action.
     

Configuration:

Configuration is kept in the config/config.yml file

- You can specify running browser using one of : ie, firefox, chrome, safari
browser: ie

- **Fixtures/Language files separated with " " (files which contains translations without the .yml extension) 
fixtures: login logout
                                                                                                              
- true / false for check for missing translation
check_translation: true

- Only will work if above check_translation is set to true.
Below is a template for regexp which will look after each scenario for missing translations ie: @

translation_tag:  "@[0-9a-zA-Z]+_[0-9a-zA-Z]+"   - this will match every string on page which fits to template                                                                   
   



How to run:                  

1) WatirCuke can be run with tags like:
./WatirCuke.rb @tag1,@tag2 output          

2) Can be run with feature files:
./WatirCuke.rb features/file.feature output

All above will produce the html output and move it into test_results folder
              
3) WatirCuke can be run with standard CUCUMBER : cucumber -t @tags -f format -o output

*screenshot - will be dropped in test_results/test_datetime/screenshots/ - this structure is created each time cucumber is being run

** Fixtures/Language files can be dropped into : 'features/fixtures' path. 
They need to be in YML format like:
login:
  login_button: Sign up 

Then in scenario you have to use it like:
 
I click the ":login.login_button" button   

That will import the value from attached fixture file.
