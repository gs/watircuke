INSTALL
         
First be sure to have installed Ruby(1.8.7) and RubyGems
       
Then install:

gem install geminstaller

Then checkout the WatirCuke git repo (if not yet done ;) ) and type

geminstaller config/geminstaller.yml

This will install all necessary gems.

Then install JSSH for FireWatir:
http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+Installation
                                                         
For MacOSX I recommend to install:
Textmate syntax recognition and snippets for Cucumber

http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle


To have WatirCuke support snippets just unpack the WatirCuke.tmbundle.zip which is in my github in TextMateBundles repo and place it in

~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

Then in TextMate -> Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles

Snippets should work for .feature files.

Below are currently supported sentences: 

Actions:

link[tab]      I click the "some" button  
checkbox[tab]  I click the "some" checkbox  
image[tab] 	   I click the "some" image

radio[tab]     I click the "some" radio button  
table[tab]	   I click row "some" in the "some" table  
list[tab]	   I select "some" from "from list"  
tf[tab]		   I fill in the text field "text field name" with "some text / fraze (from http://chronic.rubyforge.org/ are supported)"

div[tab]       I click the "some" div
*screenshot[tab] I take a screenshot

check_text[tab]	  Then I should (NOT )?see the text "some text"

Paths redirection:
red[tab]	I am redirected to "some"

Fixtures/Language files can be dropped into : 'features/fixtures' path.
After adding new file drop its name into env.rb file(17th line) to LANGUAGE constant variable.

To input its value to gherkin all you have to do is:
 
I click the ":data_example.name" link   

its important to have ':' in front of :table.column notation


tag @new_feature - putted above the scenario will force watircuke to make a screenshot after each action.

How to run:

cucumber . -f html -o output.html
 

*screenshot - will be dropped in test_results/test_datetime/screenshots/ - this structure is created each time cucumber is being run


**cukewatir maximizes the Gherkin speak and minimizes the Watir code.
