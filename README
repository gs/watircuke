Textmate syntax recognition and snippets  for Cucumber

http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle
                                


To have WatirCuke support snippets just unpack the WatirCuke.tmbundle.zip which is in my github in TextMateBundles repo and place it in

~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

Then in TextMate -> Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles

Snippets should work for .feature files.

Below are currently supported sentences:
